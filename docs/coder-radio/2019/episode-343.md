The events of this week will not affect their bottom lines, and Apple could have taken much more drastic action to lock down iOS — as it has before.

  * [Make your next C# project non-nullable](http://blog.hovland.xyz/2019-01-15-make-your-next-csharp-project-non-nullable/ "Make your next C# project non-nullable") — The naming is a bit confusing, because reference types have always been nullable, and that’s the whole problem. The novelty is that they can now also be non-nullable.

But if you tried it you probably know “just” warnings are produced. And sometimes you’d like to have errors instead of warnings, so the build fails hard or something like that. It’s surprisingly easy to do so.
