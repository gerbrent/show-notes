  * [Why Freelancing Creates Anxiety About Money](https://www.thecut.com/2019/02/why-freelancing-creates-anxiety-about-money.html "Why Freelancing Creates Anxiety About Money") — But once I started freelancing, things changed. I became hyperconscious of how much money I could (or should) charge for my time, and this made me unhappy and mean when my nonworking hours didn’t measure up to the same value. It was akin to the rage of watching cab fare tick up while you’re sitting in traffic, minutes and dollars dribbling away before your eyes.
  * [What Hooks Mean for Vue](https://css-tricks.com/what-hooks-mean-for-vue/ "What Hooks Mean for Vue") — You may read through this and wonder what Hooks have to offer in Vue. It seems like a problem that doesn’t need solving. After all, Vue doesn’t predominantly use classes. Vue offers stateless functional components (should you need them), but why would we need to carry state in a functional component?
  * [Hooks at a Glance – React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html "Hooks at a Glance – React") — Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.

They also don’t suffer from the drawbacks of mixins.
  * [Create Your Own AI Family Portraits](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NVIDIA-StyleGAN-Open-Source "Create Your Own AI Family Portraits") — This week NVIDIA's research engineers open-sourced StyleGAN, the project they've been working in for months as a Style-based generator architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks.

It simply detects when people are not talking, and adds in a bit of laughter.
