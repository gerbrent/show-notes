  * [Coder Radio 343: Say My Functional Name](https://coder.show/343 "Coder Radio 343: Say My Functional Name") — Mike breaks down the drama around nullable reference types in C# 8.0, and we debate what it means for the future of the language. 
  * [Coder Radio 358 Feedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoderRadio/comments/braxr7/batteries_are_leaking_coder_radio_358/ "Coder Radio 358 Feedback") — In the discussion of Marzipan and Electron I think the answer is WKWebView, which just arrived in macOS 10.10. 
  * [Show Content Poll](https://twitter.com/dominucco/status/1131547330019246082 "Show Content Poll") — What Do You Want More of on #CoderRadio @CoderRadioShow this is your chance to give me some feedback for the next few months! 
  * [Why Computer Programmers Should Stop Calling Themselves Engineers](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/programmers-should-not-call-themselves-engineers/414271/ "Why Computer Programmers Should Stop Calling Themselves Engineers") — The respectability of engineering, a feature built over many decades of closely controlled, education- and apprenticeship-oriented certification, becomes reinterpreted as a fast-and-loose commitment to craftwork as business.
  * [About GitHub Sponsors](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-sponsors "About GitHub Sponsors") — Anyone with a GitHub account can sponsor anyone with a sponsored developer profile through a recurring monthly payment. You can choose from multiple sponsorship tiers, with monthly payment amounts and benefits that are set by the sponsored developer.
  * [Lying to the compiler | Jon Skeet's coding blog](https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2019/05/25/lying-to-the-compiler/ "Lying to the compiler | Jon Skeet's coding blog") — I’m lying to the compiler to get it to stop it emitting a warning. The reason is that in the case where the value is null, it won’t matter that it’s null.
  * [Programming Language Tourism | Bushido Codes](https://www.bushido.codes/programming-language-tourism "Programming Language Tourism | Bushido Codes") — I am attracted to this book precisely because it is impractical. You don’t gain mastery of any programming languages. Rather, you get the chance to explore and complete a series of coding katas to expand your mind about the art of programming. 
  * [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks: A Pragmatic Guide to Learning Programming Languages by Bruce A. Tate | The Pragmatic Bookshelf](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks: A Pragmatic Guide to Learning Programming Languages by Bruce A. Tate | The Pragmatic Bookshelf") — You should learn a programming language every year, as recommended by The Pragmatic Programmer. But if one per year is good, how about Seven Languages in Seven Weeks? In this book you’ll get a hands-on tour of Clojure, Haskell, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, and Ruby.
  * [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno/ "Uno Platform") — The only platform for building native mobile, desktop and WebAssembly with C#, XAML from single codebase. Open source and professionally supported.
  * [Uno.QuickStart](https://github.com/nventive/Uno.QuickStart "Uno.QuickStart") — This repository is a basic sample for an Uno application which cross-targets UWP, iOS, Android and WebAssembly.
