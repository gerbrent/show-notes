  * [Apple Releases iOS 15 and iPadOS 15](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/ios-15-now-available/ "Apple Releases iOS 15 and iPadOS 15") — A new Focus mode cuts down on distractions by limiting what's accessible and who can contact you, and notifications can now be grouped up in daily summaries.
  * [iOS and iPadOS 15: The MacStories Review - Section on Focus](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-review/4/#content "iOS and iPadOS 15: The MacStories Review - Section on Focus") — What stood out to me when I started playing around with Apple’s presets for Focus (which include the basic Do Not Disturb, Driving, and Sleep, plus templates for Fitness, Gaming, and Reading) is the number of personalization options that were previously hard to find or not available at all with the classic Do Not Disturb.
