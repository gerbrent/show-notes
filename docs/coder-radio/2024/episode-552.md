  * [DHH on X](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1742193541999112308 "DHH on X") ‚Äî We have some great, native, dedicated apps ready for HEY Calendar. The Android one is just sitting there waiting for us to push publish in the Google Play Store. Guess what's happening to the other one for iOS? Still "in review" since mid December üôÑ
  * [DHH on X](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1742638740525187506 "DHH on X") ‚Äî Ah @apple, not this shit again. I thought we sorted it out 2.5 years ago in round one?! Why oh why must it be like this! You know we're not just going to roll over, that we're never going to pay the 30% ransom. Just approve the fucking app and we'll be on our merry way!

No. But we also don‚Äôt want to leave our customers with iPhones waiting for our awesome native HEY Calendar app.
  * [DHH on X](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1744745276932604413 "DHH on X") ‚Äî Apple approved the HEY Calendar!! It's now available for download in the @appstore . Ridiculous it needed this level of awareness/pressure, but I'm so happy for our iOS team to see their work through the weekend pay off in full. Thanks to all who cheered!
