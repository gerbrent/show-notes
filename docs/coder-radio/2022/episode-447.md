I also want 0 internet access. Is KidBuntu still a thing? @ubuntu I'd like a kid / education focused distro. THX!

That includes a smaller Mac Pro with up to 40 CPU cores and 128 graphics cores, a new Mac mini and a large-screened iMac Pro. I’d expect Apple to finish announcing its transition to its own silicon from Intel chips as early as June at WWDC 2022.
