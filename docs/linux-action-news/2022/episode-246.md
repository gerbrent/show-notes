  * [Akamai Warns Of “Panchan” Linux Botnet](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security/new-p2p-botnet-panchan "Akamai Warns Of “Panchan” Linux Botnet") — The botnet introduces a unique (and possibly novel) approach to lateral movement by harvesting of SSH keys. Instead of just using brute force or dictionary attacks on randomized IP addresses like most botnets do, the malware also reads the id_rsa and known_hosts files to harvest existing credentials and use them to move laterally across the network.
