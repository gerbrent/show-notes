  * [EvilGnome: Rare Malware Spying on Desktop Users](https://www.intezer.com/blog-evilgnome-rare-malware-spying-on-linux-desktop-users/ "EvilGnome: Rare Malware Spying on Desktop Users") — We have named the implant EvilGnome, for its disguise as a Gnome extension.

These IDs roughly correlate to the MacBook systems since the end of 2015. 
  * [Maintainer for gpodder.net needed](https://github.com/gpodder/mygpo/blob/master/maintainer-needed.md "Maintainer for gpodder.net needed") — Some effort is required to keep a website or web service running and up-to-date.
