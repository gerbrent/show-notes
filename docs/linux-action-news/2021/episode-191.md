We cannot perceive this otherwise than as an open act of hostility and we have effectively left Freenode.

The compromised passwords they find are often being used by crime rings, so the passwords' quick addition to the HIBP database would be extremely helpful. That said, the website doesn't have a way for the feds to quickly feed passwords into its database yet.
