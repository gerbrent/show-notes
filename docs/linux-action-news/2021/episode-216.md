  * [Linux has a serious security problem that once again enables DNS cache poisoning](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/dan-kaminskys-dns-cache-poisoning-attack-is-back-from-the-dead-again/ "Linux has a serious security problem that once again enables DNS cache poisoning") — We can actually guess the ephemeral port in the embedded UDP packet and package it in an ICMP probe to a DNS resolver. If the guessed port is correct, it causes some global resource in the Linux kernel to change, which can be indirectly observed. This is how the attacker can infer which ephemeral port is used.

To normal consumers, that's clearly not going to do much to help and probably scare them away. Now, instead, it will provide a very clear and friendly message, with the option to get more details to report the issue.
