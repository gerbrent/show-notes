  * [LTS versions of Qt going closed-source](https://www.theregister.com/2021/01/05/qt_lts_goes_commercial_only/ "LTS versions of Qt going closed-source") — The Qt Company is making LTS releases commercial only and thus closed-source. "The problem is that these releases are in effect no longer maintained. If there is a security issue, or a fix needed to support some change in one of the target operating systems, open-source users will not get that fix other than in the not-ready version 6.0."

  * [A shell UX update – GNOME Shell & Mutter](https://blogs.gnome.org/shell-dev/2021/01/07/a-shell-ux-update "A shell UX update – GNOME Shell & Mutter") — The new design has prompted a lot of interest and comment, which we’re all really thrilled about. In this post I wanted to provide an update of where the initiative is at. I also want to take the opportunity to answer some of the common questions that have come up.

  * [Dissecting the Apple M1 GPU, part I](https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-1.html "Dissecting the Apple M1 GPU, part I") — A few weeks ago, I purchased a Mac Mini with an M1 GPU as a development target to study the instruction set and command stream, to understand the GPU’s architecture at a level not previously publicly understood, and ultimately to accelerate the development of a Mesa driver for the hardware. Today I’ve reached my first milestone: I now understand enough of the instruction set to disassemble simple shaders with a free and open-source tool chain, released on GitHub.

Kurzinger continues to mention that once a driver is out with the needed hooks, this code should “just start working”.
