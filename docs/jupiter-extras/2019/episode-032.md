  * [Mental Health Hackers Website](https://www.mentalhealthhackers.org/ "Mental Health Hackers Website") — Our mission is to educate tech professionals about the unique mental health risks faced by those in our field – and often by the people who we share our lives with – and provide guidance on reducing their effects and better manage the triggering causes. 
  * [Mental Health First Aid](http://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org "Mental Health First Aid") — Mental Health First Aid is a skills-based training course that teaches participants about mental health and substance-use issues. 
  * [Hackers, Hugs, & Drugs: Mental Health in Infosec](https://youtu.be/7cP9np_3yWI "Hackers, Hugs, & Drugs: Mental Health in Infosec") — The information security community is difficult to compare to any other. We are composed of intelligent, driven, passionate, opinionated individuals. When you combine the pressure and stress we put on ourselves in the form of research, learning, teaching, and creating it starts to build up. Not only do we put pressure on ourselves, but we also take it on from our bosses, co-workers, and family in many different forms. The end result is that many of us are broken. We need to bring to light a topic that shouldn't be as faux pas as it is. I'll share my personal struggles, stories of friends and family, and hopefully help us come closer together as a community to help you or people around you.
