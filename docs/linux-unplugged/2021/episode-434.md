The post is really long, and it seems unlikely that I and the author will ever agree on this topic, so I’m only going to talk about a couple of paragraphs about disk usage and sharing of runtimes between apps which caught my eye.

  * [Flatpak Is Not the Future - Ludocode](https://ludocode.com/blog/flatpak-is-not-the-future "Flatpak Is Not the Future - Ludocode") — Flatpak calls itself “the future of application distribution”. I am not a fan. I’m going to outline here some of the technical, security and usability problems with Flatpak and others. I’ll try to avoid addressing “fixable” problems (like theming) and instead focus on fundamental problems inherent in their design. I aim to convince you that these are not the future of desktop Linux apps.

  * [Seeking contractors for work on Flathub project](https://discourse.flathub.org/t/seeking-contractors-for-work-on-flathub-project/1889 "Seeking contractors for work on Flathub project") — GNOME has a donor who is interested in supporting financial sustainability for app developers and removing barriers to an inclusive ecosystem. Flathub would like to use these funds to work with a contractor for a short-term project and make steps towards supporting application developers being able to request payments (whether donations or subscriptions).
