  * [Btrfs Set To Land Support For IDMAPPED Mounts In Linux 5.15](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Btrfs-IDMAPPED-Mounts "Btrfs Set To Land Support For IDMAPPED Mounts In Linux 5.15") — Back when IDMAPPED mounts functionality was added to the Linux kernel, the initial implementation came for FAT and EXT4. XFS support has also been in the works while now for Linux 5.15 the Btrfs support appears ready.
  * [IDMAPPED Mounts Aim For Linux 5.12 - Many New Use-Cases From Containers To Systemd-Homed](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=IDMAPPED-Mounts-Linux-5.12 "IDMAPPED Mounts Aim For Linux 5.12 - Many New Use-Cases From Containers To Systemd-Homed") — Idmapped mounts make it possible to easily share files between multiple users or multiple machines especially in complex scenarios. For example, idmapped mounts will be used in the implementation of portable home directories in systemd-homed.service(8) where they allow users to move their home directory to an external storage device and use it on multiple computers where they are assigned different uids and gids.

Upstream Snap still doesn't have the support yet but there are patches pending that are still expected to be merged this cycle.
  * [Fedora 35 To Support Restarting User Services On Package Upgrades](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Fedora-35-User-Service-Restart "Fedora 35 To Support Restarting User Services On Package Upgrades") — What this ultimately means is that user services like PipeWire can seamlessly restart when upgrading them via Fedora RPM updates rather than needing to manually do so or restarting the system for the upgrade to take effect.
