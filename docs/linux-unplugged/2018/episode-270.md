It can be compared to ZFS, Btrfs, or LVM. Its focus is on simplicity of concepts and ease of use, while giving users access to advanced storage features. Internally, Stratis's implementation favors tight integration of existing components instead of the fully-integrated, in-kernel approach that ZFS and Btrfs use.

For low to mid-end systems, it doesn’t seem to be able to do much to improve your performance.
