Don't fall into the cycle of arguing about those "others" in the "Judean People's Front" when we are the "We're the People's Front of Judea!" That is the trap that countless communities have fallen into over the centuries. We all share the same goal, let us never loose sight of that.

To that end, we designed Thelio Io, a daughter board that manages thermal and chassis control while also providing a storage backplane for the drives in Thelio. It’s open hardware and open source firmware, and a big step in the right direction.

  * [IBM TO ACQUIRE RED HAT](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-acquire-red-hat-completely-changing-cloud-landscape-and-becoming-worlds-1-hybrid-cloud-provider?intcmp=701f2000000RWK2AAO "IBM TO ACQUIRE RED HAT") — IBM will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Red Hat for $190.00 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $34 billion.

Replacing UNIX is no longer sufficient. The decline in RHEL growth contrasted with the acceleration in Linux more broadly is a strong market indicator of the next wave of open source. Public cloud workloads have largely avoided RHEL. 
  * [RHEL 7.6 Released](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-refines-hybrid-cloud-innovation-latest-version-world%E2%80%99s-leading-enterprise-linux-platform "RHEL 7.6 Released") — Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 is designed to be the trusted bedrock for hybrid cloud deployments
  * [Announcing the release of Fedora 29](https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-29/ "Announcing the release of Fedora 29") — This release is particularly exciting because it’s the first to include the Fedora Modularity feature across all our different variants. Modularity lets us ship different versions of packages on the same Fedora base. 
  * [What is Modularity :: Fedora Docs Site](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/modularity/ "What is Modularity :: Fedora Docs Site") — Different users have different needs. Developers want the latest versions possible, system administrators want stability for longer period of time. There are many Linux distributions out there, each targeting a different audience, for example Fedora vs. CentOS.
  * [Working with modules in Fedora](https://fedoramagazine.org/working-modules-fedora-28/ "Working with modules in Fedora") — This article puts one of those modules to practical use, covering installation and setup of Review Board 3.0 using modules.
  * [Blog - Chris Goes to MeetBSD](https://linuxunplugged.com/articles/meetbsd2018 "Blog - Chris Goes to MeetBSD") — MeetBSD 2018 took place at the sprawling Intel Santa Clara campus. The venue itself felt more like an olive branch than a simple friendly gesture by Intel. In truth it felt like a bit of an apology. You get the subtle sense they feel bad about how the BSD's were treated with the Meltdown and Specter flaws.
