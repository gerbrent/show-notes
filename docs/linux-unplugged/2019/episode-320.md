  * [CentOS 8.1905](https://wiki.centos.org/Manuals/ReleaseNotes/CentOS8.1905 "CentOS 8.1905") — Hello and welcome to the first CentOS-8 release. The CentOS Linux distribution is a stable, predictable, manageable and reproducible platform derived from the sources of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).
  * [CentOS Stream](https://wiki.centos.org/Manuals/ReleaseNotes/CentOSStream#head-d7420bfe84e1b43150d63693bb1e001f0bd0e8f8 "CentOS Stream") — CentOS Stream will be a rolling-release Linux distro that exists as a midstream between the upstream development in Fedora Linux and the downstream development for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It is a cleared-path to contributing into future minor releases of RHEL while interacting with Red Hat and other open source developers. This pairs nicely with the existing contribution path in Fedora for future major releases of RHEL. 
  * [Transforming the development experience within CentOS](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/transforming-development-experience-within-centos "Transforming the development experience within CentOS") — The CentOS Stream project sits between the Fedora Project and RHEL in the RHEL Development process, providing a "rolling preview" of future RHEL kernels and features. This enables developers to stay one or two steps ahead of what’s coming in RHEL, which was not previously possible with traditional CentOS releases
  * [Reinventing Home Directories](https://media.ccc.de/v/ASG2019-164-reinventing-home-directories "Reinventing Home Directories") — The concept of home directories on Linux/UNIX has little changed in the last 39 years. It's time to have a closer look, and bring them up to today's standards, regarding encryption, storage, authentication, user records, and more.
