There’s even a TrackPoint-like pointing nub. 
  * [Darling Picks Up New Contributors For Its macOS Compatibility Layer On Linux](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Darling-2019-New-Contribs "Darling Picks Up New Contributors For Its macOS Compatibility Layer On Linux") — Darling is the long-standing (albeit for some years idling) effort to allow macOS binaries to run on Linux that is akin to Wine but focused on an Apple macOS layer rather than Windows. This summer it's been moving along and seeing some new developer contributions. 
  * [Darling Progress Report Q2 2019](http://blog.darlinghq.org/2019/07/darling-progress-report-q2-2019.html "Darling Progress Report Q2 2019") — We are very excited to say that in Q2 2019 (April 1 to June 30) we saw more community involvement than ever before. Many pull requests were submitted that spanned from bug fixes for our low level assembly to higher level modules such as the AppKit framework. Thanks to everyone for your contributions and we hope for this level of engagement to continue.

This is apparently due to the SD card driver breaking when more than 1 GB of RAM is present. This will all be solved eventually but until then I recommend using the 32 bit version of Ubuntu or waiting until the Raspberry Pi 4 support catches up. If you want to run the 64 bit one now anyway it works fine other than the memory limitation.

Every Fedora CoreOS system begins with a generic, unconfigured disk image. On first boot Ignition will read the supplied config and configure the system. Ignition configs are usually supplied via the cloud’s userdata mechanism, or, in the case of bare metal, injected at install time. This guide will show you how to launch Fedora CoreOS on AWS, QEMU, and bare metal as well as how to create Ignition configs.
