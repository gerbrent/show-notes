The criminals even made sure the file size of the malicious utility stayed the same as that of the original one.
  * [Shadow Hammer APT MAC Check](https://shadowhammer.kaspersky.com/ "Shadow Hammer APT MAC Check") — Check if your device has been targeted by the ShadowHammer cyberattack
  * [SigintOS: A Linux Distro for Signal Intelligence](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/sigintos-a-linux-distro-for-signal-intelligence/ "SigintOS: A Linux Distro for Signal Intelligence") — SigintOS is an Ubuntu based distribution with a number of built in signal intelligence applications for software defined radios such as RTL-SDRs and other TX capable SDRs like the HackRF, bladeRF and USRP radios. 
  * [SigintOS](https://www.sigintos.com/about/ "SigintOS") — SigintOS; as the name suggests, SIGINT is an improved Linux distribution for Signal Intelligence.

  * [Tainted kernels — The Linux Kernel documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.20/admin-guide/tainted-kernels.html "Tainted kernels — The Linux Kernel documentation") — The primary reason for the ‘Tainted: ‘ string is to tell kernel debuggers if this is a clean kernel or if anything unusual has occurred. 
  * [What is a tainted kernel in Linux?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/118116/what-is-a-tainted-kernel-in-linux/118117#118117 "What is a tainted kernel in Linux?") — The feature is intended to identify conditions which may make it difficult to properly troubleshoot a kernel problem. For example, the loading of a proprietary module can make kernel debug output unreliable because kernel developers don't have access to the module's source code and therefore cannot determine what the module may have done to the kernel. Likewise, if the kernel had previously experienced an error condition or if a serious hardware error had occurred, the debug information generated by the kernel may not be reliable.
  * [Install Fests - Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/install-fest-devil "Install Fests - Free Software Foundation") — My new idea is that the install fest could allow the devil to hang around, off in a corner of the hall, or the next room. (Actually, a human being wearing sign saying “The Devil,” and maybe a toy mask or horns.) The devil would offer to install nonfree drivers in the user's machine to make more parts of the computer function, explaining to the user that the cost of this is using a nonfree (unjust) program.
